Final Project during Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2016.

The program features a login database, chat room, survey, and attractive UI/UX. The goal of this web application was to combat unconcious bias by matching people with those who they are unconciously bias towards (which would be in the results of the survey) and having them anonymously chat with each other in the chat room.
